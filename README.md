A new way to surf the web. Wear your 3D anaglyph glasses and web pages will gain the third dimension.

Just click the "Z3D" button to activate the anaglyph effect. Click again to turn it off. You can choose between Red-Cyan, Red-Blue, Red-Green and Amber-Blue glasses. Z3D creates impressive text animations.

This is probably the useless software ever written... but I bet you'll try to touch the fonts coming out of your monitor.
